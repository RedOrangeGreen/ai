    <h1>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h1>
    
    <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which are instances of classes containing data and code. The key concepts of OOP include:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Classes:</strong> User-defined data types that act as blueprints for creating objects, defining their attributes and methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Objects:</strong> Instances of classes that contain data and can perform actions through methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> The principle of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (object), hiding internal details and restricting access to the object's internal state.</li>
        <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they share, hiding unnecessary details.</li>
        <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> A mechanism that allows new classes to be based on existing classes, inheriting their attributes and methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> The ability of objects to take on multiple forms and for the same interface to be used for different underlying forms.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>OOP focuses on creating reusable, modular code that is easier to maintain and understand. It allows developers to model real-world entities and their relationships in code, making it well-suited for large, complex software systems.</p>

    <h2>Popular OOP Languages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>C#</li>
    </ul>

    <p>OOP has become a dominant programming paradigm, particularly for developing graphical user interfaces and large-scale software applications.</p>

    <h2>Advantages of OOP</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Improved code organization</li>
        <li>Reusability</li>
        <li>Scalability</li>
        <li>Easier collaboration among developers working on large projects</li>
    </ul>
